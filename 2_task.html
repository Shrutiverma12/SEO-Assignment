      SEO stands for Search Engine Optiization. It helps you optimize your
      websites so that they have better rankings on Search Engines like Google,
      Bing and Yahoo. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to
      help attract website visitors who will become customers, clients or an
      audience that keeps coming back.

      The world of search engine optimization is complex and ever-changing, but
      you can easily understand the basics, and even a small amount of SEO
      knowledge can make a big difference. Free SEO education is also widely
      available on the web, including in guides.
